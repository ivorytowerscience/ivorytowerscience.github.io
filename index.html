The principle investigator must clearly explain the relevance of and need for this type of research to the reviewers.</p>
<p>Topics may include applied scientific research into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fermented foods</li>
  <li>Fermented beverages</li>
  <li>Biofuels or bioprocessing</li>
</ul>
<p>Or topics relating to social, economic, or cultural aspects of Fermentation Sciences.</p>
